# **Automatic Accident, Drowsiness, and Drunk Driving Detection System Using Raspberry Pi**

## **1. Summary**
This project leverages a Raspberry Pi to create an automated system for detecting road accidents, driver drowsiness, and drunk driving. Upon detecting an accident, the system sends alerts via email and SMS to the nearest hospital, police station, and the driver's family members. The system also monitors the driver’s eyes to detect drowsiness and triggers alarms while stopping the vehicle if the driver’s eyes remain closed for more than a second. Additionally, the system includes a drunk driving detection feature that prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver is intoxicated.

### **Importance of the Project**
In India, road accidents are a major public health issue. According to data from 2023:
- **Accidents:** Over 150,000 people lose their lives in road accidents annually.
- **Drowsiness:** Driver fatigue is a significant factor, contributing to nearly 20% of all road accidents.
- **Drunk Driving:** Drunk driving accounts for around 30% of the fatalities, making it a critical area for intervention.

These statistics highlight the urgent need for technology-driven solutions to reduce road accidents and save lives.

## **2. Acknowledgment**
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Mentor’s Name], who provided invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. Special thanks to my family and friends for their encouragement, as well as to [Institution Name] for providing the necessary resources and environment to develop this project.

## **3. Introduction and Objectives**
### **Introduction**
Road accidents are a significant cause of death and injury worldwide, and India is no exception. The country's road safety statistics reveal alarming figures:
- In 2023, over 150,000 fatalities were recorded due to road accidents.
- Driver drowsiness was a contributing factor in about 20% of these accidents, leading to severe injuries and fatalities.
- Drunk driving remains a leading cause, responsible for approximately 30% of road fatalities.

This project aims to address these issues by integrating accident detection, drowsiness detection, and drunk driving detection systems using Raspberry Pi.

### **Objectives**
- **Accident Detection:** To automatically detect accidents and immediately notify emergency services and family members.
- **Drowsiness Detection:** To prevent accidents by detecting driver fatigue and alerting the driver.
- **Drunk Driving Detection:** To prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is detected as drunk.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** To send real-time notifications via email and SMS with the location and details of the accident.
- **Vehicle Control:** To take preventive measures by stopping the vehicle when the driver is detected as drowsy or preventing the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk.

## **4. Materials and Equipment Required**
- **Raspberry Pi 4** (or compatible model)
- **Pi Camera Module**
- **MPU-6050 Accelerometer & Gyroscope**
- **GSM Module**
- **GPS Module**
- **MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor** (for detecting alcohol in the driver's breath)
- **Buzzer**
- **Red LED**
- **Relay Module**
- **Power Supply for Raspberry Pi and peripherals**
- **Internet Connection**
- **Python Libraries:**
  - OpenCV
  - SMTP library
  - Twilio API or similar
  - GPSD library
  - Adafruit_Python_MPU6050

## **5. Principle**
The project is based on the principles of sensor data acquisition, image processing, and real-time communication:
- **Accident Detection:** The accelerometer measures the force exerted on the vehicle. If the force exceeds a pre-set threshold, it is interpreted as an accident. The system then fetches the GPS location and sends alert messages.
- **Drowsiness Detection:** The camera monitors the driver's eyes using facial landmark detection algorithms. If the eyes are closed for more than one second, the system triggers an alert and engages the vehicle's stopping mechanism.
- **Drunk Driving Detection:** The MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor detects the presence of alcohol in the driver's breath. If the alcohol level exceeds a certain threshold, the vehicle’s ignition system is disabled, preventing the vehicle from starting.

## **6. Procedure**
1. **Setup the Raspberry Pi:**
   - Install Raspberry Pi OS and configure the system.
   - Connect the Pi Camera, GPS module, GSM module, accelerometer, and alcohol sensor.
   - Install required Python libraries.
   
2. **Accident Detection:**
   - Write a Python script to continuously monitor the accelerometer data.
   - Implement a threshold to detect when an accident occurs.
   - Retrieve GPS coordinates.
   - Compose and send alert messages via email and SMS to predefined contacts.
   
3. **Drowsiness Detection:**
   - Set up the camera feed and process it using OpenCV.
   - Implement an eye-tracking algorithm to detect eye closure.
   - Trigger a buzzer, light up a red LED, and engage the relay to stop the vehicle if drowsiness is detected.
   
4. **Drunk Driving Detection:**
   - Interface the MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor with the Raspberry Pi.
   - Write a Python script to monitor alcohol levels in the driver’s breath.
   - If alcohol is detected above the threshold, disable the vehicle’s ignition system using the relay module.
   
5. **Integration:**
   - Test each component separately for functionality.
   - Integrate the accident detection, drowsiness detection, and drunk driving detection modules.
   - Conduct real-world testing to fine-tune the system.

## **7. Results (Till the Progress Report Submission)**
- **Accident Detection System:** Successfully implemented and tested in controlled conditions. The system reliably detects accidents and sends alerts with the correct location and details.
- **Drowsiness Detection System:** The system can detect eye closure and triggers alarms as expected. Integration with the vehicle control system is in progress.
- **Drunk Driving Detection System:** The alcohol sensor effectively detects the presence of alcohol and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver is intoxicated.
- **Testing:** Preliminary testing shows promising results, with accurate detection and timely alerts.

## **8. Conclusions and Discussion**
### **Conclusions**
The project has made significant progress in accident detection, drowsiness detection, and drunk driving detection. The accident detection system is fully operational and successfully sends alerts in real-time. The drowsiness detection system functions as expected, and the drunk driving detection system effectively prevents the vehicle from starting when alcohol is detected.

### **Discussion**
While the core functionality has been implemented, further testing and fine-tuning are required to ensure reliability in all possible scenarios. Integration with various vehicle models and the expansion of the alert system to include more communication channels could enhance the project.

**Remaining Tasks:**
- Complete the integration of the drowsiness detection system with the vehicle control mechanism.
- Perform extensive real-world testing and adjust algorithms for better accuracy.
- Optimize the system for power efficiency and response time.
