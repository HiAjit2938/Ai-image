### **Enhance Road Safety with Our Intelligent Detection System**

**Project Title:** Automatic Accident, Drowsiness, and Drunk Driving Detection System Using Raspberry Pi

**Project Overview:**  
Every year, thousands of lives are lost in road accidents, many of which could be prevented with timely intervention. Our project harnesses the power of technology to address this critical issue by developing a comprehensive safety system for vehicles. This intelligent system not only detects accidents in real-time but also prevents them by monitoring the driver's alertness and sobriety.

**Key Features:**

1. **Accident Detection:** Instantly detects collisions and sends alerts to the nearest hospital, police station, and the driver’s family members with precise GPS coordinates.
   
2. **Drowsiness Detection:** Monitors the driver’s eyes and triggers an alarm if drowsiness is detected, preventing accidents by stopping the vehicle if necessary.

3. **Drunk Driving Prevention:** Ensures the vehicle does not start if the driver is detected as intoxicated, thereby avoiding potential accidents due to impaired driving.

**Why It Matters:**
- **150,000+ Fatalities Annually:** Over 150,000 lives are lost in road accidents in India every year, many due to drowsiness and drunk driving.
- **Proactive Safety:** By addressing the root causes of many accidents—fatigue and intoxication—our system actively prevents accidents before they happen.
- **Real-Time Response:** In the event of an accident, immediate alerts are sent to ensure a swift emergency response, potentially saving lives.

**Impact:**
Our project not only contributes to safer roads but also promotes responsible driving behavior. By integrating advanced technology into vehicles, we can significantly reduce the number of road fatalities and create a safer environment for all road users.

**Join Us in Making Roads Safer:**  
Support our initiative to revolutionize road safety with technology. Together, we can reduce accidents, save lives, and make our roads safer for everyone.
